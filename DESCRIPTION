Package: IRSanalysis
Title: Package to plot impact response surfaces
Description: This package contains functions to plot impact response
	surfaces (IRSs), 2-dimensional contour plots of tabled data that define
	values (in z-dim) to pairs of coordinates (x- and y-dimensions). These
	can be results of model simulations from a sensitivity analysis of two
	variables that have been perturbed jointly, e.g. the sensitivity of an
	impact model to changes in temperature and precipitation. This package
	was published as a supplement to Fronzek et al. (2022,
	doi:10.1016/j.crm.2022.100466). Earlier versions of the code were used 
	by Fronzek et al. (2011, doi:10.5194/nhess-11-2981-2011), Pirttioja et al.
	(2015, doi:10.3354/cr01322), Fronzek et al. (2019,
	doi:10.1007/s10113-018-1421-8) and Pirttioja et al. (2019,
	doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.10.006)
